High-level interactions

Returning a game: Returning a game if I did not enjoy it, would delete it from the Games table, 
references to it in the Consoles or Systems table (affecting the Belong to a Console or System relationship), it would also affect the belongs to a Saga, 
but it would remain in the Enjoyment table, as a reminder not to buy the game again, but the relationship would be deleted, as we no longer own it. 

Buying a game: By buying a game, it must be registered in the Games table, a relationship should be created to the Belong to Saga, and Belongs to a Console or System
But an entry to the enjoyment table should not be immediately added, as we can buy a game, without playing it for a long time.
