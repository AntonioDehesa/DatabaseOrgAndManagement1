Use the attached createEmptDeptManages_v3 script and attached data files to load a small employee database. There are three relations:

Employee (eid, name, age, salary, residenceState, startDate)

Department (did, name, floor, supplyBudget, stateLocated)

WorksFor (eid, did, startDate ) 



Answer the following null value queries:

Which employees do not have a known residenceState?  

None, they all have a residence state

Which departments do not have a known supplyBudget?

Once again, none. they all have a known supplybudget

Use outer joins to answer the two following queries:

Which employees do not work in any department?

select e.name from employee e left outer join worksfor wf on e.eid = wf.eid
where wf.did is null

Which departments have no employees working for them?

select d.name from department d left outer join worksfor wf on d.did = wf.did
where wf.eid is null
