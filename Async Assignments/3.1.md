Consider our ski resort data example: 

PassHolder (passID, name, age, streetAddress, city, state)

Resort (resortName, city, state, baseElevation, verticalFeet)

Lift (liftNumber, baseElevation, topElevation, numSeats, speed)

ValidAt (passID, resortName )

PartOf (resortName, liftNumber 

Rode (passID, liftNumber, date, time)



Write SQL queries for:

1. Find the passID of pass holders whose pass is valid at each and every resort.

with uniqueResort as (select distinct resortName from Resort)
select passID from validAt vA
where resortName in (select resortName from Resort)
group by passID
having count(distinct resortName) = (select count(*) from uniqueResort)

2. Find the name of pass holders who have ridden every lift.

Let R = project name, passID | PassHolder
Let S = project passID | Rode

Ans = R / S

select distinct passID, name
from passHolder as ph
where not exists 
(select liftNumber 
	from rode 
    where liftNumber not in 
		(select liftNumber
			from rode as r 
            where ph.passID = r.passID
		)
);

3. Find the name of pass holders who have ridden every lift operated by Vail Resorts.

Let R = project passID, liftNumber | Rode
let S = project liftNumber | select resortName = "Vail Resorts" | PartOf
let T = R / S
project name | PassHolder equi join T

with r as (select r.passID, r.liftNumber from rode r) 
,s as (select liftNumber from partof po
where po.resortName = "A"),
t as (
select distinct passID
from r
where not exists 
(select liftNumber 
	from s 
    where liftNumber not in 
		(select liftNumber
			from rode as g 
            where r.passID = g.passID
		)
))
select pa.name from passholder pa, t where
pa.passID = t.passID

4. Find the name and city of resorts that have at least one lift whose base elevation is below 9,000 feet.

project name, city | Resort equi join ( select baseElevation < 9000 | Lift equi join PartOf )

with suitableLifts as (select po.resortName from Lift l, partof po where l.liftNumber = po.liftNumber and baseElevation < 9000)
select r.resortName, r.city from Resort r, suitableLifts s
where r.resortName = s.resortName

5. Find the name and state of pass holders that hold a valid pass for a resort that is located in the same state they live in.

let R = project r.resortName | (passholder equi join resort on r.state = ph.state)
let S = select va.passID | (R equi join validAt)
project ph.name,ph.state | (passHolder equi join S)

with suitableResorts as (select r.resortName from passholder ph, resort r where r.state=ph.state),
suitablepassholders as (select va.passID from suitableResorts, validAt va where suitableResorts.resortName = va.resortName)
select ph.name, ph.state from passholder ph, suitablepassholders where ph.passID = suitablepassholders.passID

6. Find the resorts that have at least one lift whose top elevation is above 12,000 feet.

project name,city | Resort equi join ( select topElevation > 12000 | Lift equi join PartOf )

with suitableLifts as (select po.resortName from Lift l, partof po where l.liftNumber = po.liftNumber and topElevation > 12000)
select r.resortName from Resort r, suitableLifts s
where r.resortName = s.resortName

7. Find the liftNumber of all lifts that have been ridden by pass holders that live in the city of Denver.

project liftNumber | rode equi join (project passID | select city="Denver" | passholder) on passID

with residentsOfDenver as (select ph.passID from passholder ph where ph.city = "Denver")
select r.liftNumber from residentsOfDenver, rode r where r.passID = residentsOfDenver.passID
