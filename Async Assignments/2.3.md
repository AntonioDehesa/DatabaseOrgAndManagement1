1. Using only the five fundamental operators (no joins, just cartesian product), find the name and age of pass holders who have rode lift number 12345 on 1999-12-31.

project name, age | select PassHolder.passID = Rode.passID | PassHolder x ( select date = 1999-12-31 | select liftNumber = 12345 | select Lift.liftNumber = Rode.liftNumber | (Lift x Rode) )

2. Same query as (1), but do not use cartesian product, instead use equi-join.

project name, age | PassHolder equi join ( select date = 1999-12-31 | select liftNumber = 12345 |  (Lift equi join Rode) )

3. Using joins (not cartesian product), find the name and city of resorts that have one or more lifts whose top elevation is greater than 12,500 feet.

project name, city | Resort equi join ( select topElevation > 12500 | Lift equi join PartOf )

4. Using joins, find the name of pass holders who rode a lift operated by resort “Vail.”

project name | PassHolder equi join ( select resortName = "Vail." | PartOf equi join Rode )
